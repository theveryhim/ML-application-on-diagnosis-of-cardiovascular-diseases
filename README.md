# Diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases
Our goal in this exercise is to predict(true labels available!) the existence of these diseases in people using standard information about people's health and different classification methods in machine learning.
- Dataset Preparation
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Perceptron Classifier
- MLP Neural networks
- Decision Tree
